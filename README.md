This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

To use this tool in your own projects, start by cloning this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DanilPidhainyi/react-emoji-search
```

Then once the folder is inside your code editor, install all the necessary packages.

```sh
yarn install
```

Once you are ready and have made changes, run:

```sh
yarn start
```

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Once you have finished developing the app and are ready to build, run:

```sh
yarn build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
